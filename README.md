# To update momisms

Place momisms in the YAML file ```_data/momisms.yml```. These should be able to be copy and pasted from the website. You may need the command ```%s/<br> /^M /g``` in vim to replace all page breaks with a line space. Otherwise, most of the data creates itself through loops. Also, watch out for certain lines where the copy and paste from Google might not function properly.
