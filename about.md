By Jove (momism ID [#47](/list.html#momism_id47)), son ([#115](/list.html#momism_id115)), a [searchable](search.html) list of [all {{ site.data.momisms.size }}](list.html) of mother's momisms!

But wait, isn't a momism [_an undue dependence on maternal protection, resulting in loss of independence_](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/momism)? Most certainly not! In our family, we know the true definition. A momism is a word that only our mother says; or barring that, when we hear this word, our mother pops immediately to mind.

This website contains a [searchable](/search.html) list of [all {{ site.data.momisms.size }} momisms](/list.html) compiled by her children since 2009, thanks to our good ears for language and our great fingers for typing (momism ID [#191](/list.html#momism_id191)).

Her children's faces upon hearing a new momism: ![confused smiley]({{ site.icon }}){: height="25px" hspace="" class="w3-spin"}
