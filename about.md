The dictionary defines a momism as _excessive adulation of the mother and undue dependence on maternal care or protection, resulting in absence or loss of maturity and independence._ But in our family, we know the true definition. A momism is a word that, as far as we know, only our mother says and, in any case, when we hear this word or phrase, our mother pops immediately to mind.

This website contains a searchable list of {{ site.data.momisms.size }} momisms compiled by her children since 2009, with our good ears for language and our good fingers for typing.
