By Jove (momism ID #[47](/list.html#momism_id47)),  a [searchable](search.html) list of [all {{ site.data.momisms.size }}](list.html) of mother's momisms â€” the whole shebangdasium (#[141](/list.html#momism_id141)), compiled by her children (a.k.a. son (#[115](/list.html#momism_id115)), blue-eyes([255](list.html#momism_id255), and baby doll (#[132](/list.html#momism_id132))), since 2009, thanks to our good ears for language and our great fingers for typing (#[191](/list.html#momism_id191)).

But wait, isn't a momism [_an undue dependence on maternal protection, resulting in loss of independence_](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/momism)? Certainly not! 

Suffice it to say (#[24](/list.html#momism_id24)), in these parts (#[142](/list.html#momism_id142)), we know the true definition. A momism is a word that only our mother says; or barring that, when we hear this word, our mother pops immediately to mind.

Our faces upon hearing a new momism: ![confused smiley]({{ site.icon }}){: height="25px" width="25px" class="w3-spin"}
