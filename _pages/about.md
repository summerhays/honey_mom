By Jove (momism ID #[47](/list.html#momism_id47)),  a [searchable](search.html) list of [all {{ site.data.mom-csv.size }}](list.html) of mother's momisms â€” the whole shebangdasium (#[144](/list.html#momism_id144)), compiled by her children (a.k.a. son (#[120](/list.html#momism_id120)), blue-eyes (#[14](list.html#momism_id14)), and baby doll (#[136](/list.html#momism_id136))), since 2009, thanks to our good ears for language and our great fingers for typing (#[193](/list.html#momism_id193)). Noting our mother's love for "of the day" websites such as NASA's [Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD)](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/){: rel="noopener" target="_blank"}, we designed this website to highlight one momism per day (MOD).

But wait, isn't a momism [_an undue dependence on maternal protection, resulting in loss of independence_](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/momism){: rel="noopener" target="_blank"}? Certainly not! 

Suffice it to say (#[34](/list.html#momism_id34)), in these parts (#[115](/list.html#momism_id115)), we know the true definition. A momism is a word that only our mother says; or barring that, when we hear this word, our mother pops immediately to mind.

Our faces upon hearing a new momism: ![confused smiley]({{ site.icon }}){: height="25px" width="25px" class="w3-spin"}
