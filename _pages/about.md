By Jove (momism ID #[46](/list.html#momism_id46)),  a [searchable](search.html) list of [all {{ site.data.momisms.size }}](list.html) of mother's momisms â€” the whole shebangdasium (#[142](/list.html#momism_id142)), compiled by her children (a.k.a. son (#[118](/list.html#momism_id118)), blue-eyes (#[14](list.html#momism_id14)), and baby doll (#[134](/list.html#momism_id134))), since 2009, thanks to our good ears for language and our great fingers for typing (#[191](/list.html#momism_id191)).

But wait, isn't a momism [_an undue dependence on maternal protection, resulting in loss of independence_](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/momism)? Certainly not! 

Suffice it to say (#[34](/list.html#momism_id34)), in these parts (#[113](/list.html#momism_id113)), we know the true definition. A momism is a word that only our mother says; or barring that, when we hear this word, our mother pops immediately to mind.

Our faces upon hearing a new momism: ![confused smiley]({{ site.icon }}){: height="25px" width="25px" class="w3-spin"}
